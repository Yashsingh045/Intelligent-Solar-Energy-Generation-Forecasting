# Intelligent-Solar-Energy-Generation-Forecasting

AI-driven analytics system that forecasts solar energy generation
using historical and weather data, and extend it into an agentic AI assistant that generates
structured grid optimization and energy utilization recommendations.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle - Solar energy power generation dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stucom/solar-energy-power-generation-dataset). It contains historical solar energy generation data along with relevant weather information.
